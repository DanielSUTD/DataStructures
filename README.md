# What is Data Structure?
A data structure is a particular way of organising data in a computer so that it can be used effectively. The idea is to reduce the space and time complexities of different tasks. 

# Where is Data Structures and Algorithms Needed?
- For managing large amounts of data, such as in a social network or a search engine.
- For scheduling tasks, to decide which task a computer should do first.
- For planning routes, like in a GPS system to find the shortest path from A to B.
- For optimizing processes, such as arranging tasks so they can be completed as quickly as possible.
- For solving complex problems: From finding the best way to pack a truck to making a computer 'learn' from data.
